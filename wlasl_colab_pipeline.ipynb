    "This notebook implements a complete WLASL pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ✅ **Setup**: Installed dependencies and downloaded MediaPipe model\n",
    "2. ✅ **Data Access**: Mounted Google Drive for dataset access\n",
    "3. ✅ **Preprocessing**: Extracted hand landmarks from videos into fixed-length sequences\n",
    "4. ✅ **Model Training**: Trained LSTM classifier on landmark sequences\n",
    "5. ✅ **Evaluation**: Assessed model performance with metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Download the trained model**: Save `wlasl_sequence_model.keras` and `wlasl_labels.npy` to your Drive\n",
    "- **Adjust hyperparameters**: Experiment with `LSTM_UNITS`, `DROPOUT`, `LEARNING_RATE`, etc.\n",
    "- **Expand dataset**: Add more glosses or videos to improve performance\n",
    "- **Deploy**: Use the model in a real-time inference application\n",
    "\n",
    "### Files Generated:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `wlasl_landmarks.npz` - Preprocessed landmark sequences\n",
    "- `wlasl_sequence_model.keras` - Trained LSTM model\n",
